# kshitij_07 

Thanks for stopping by. This repository contains the code of my **Currently under development** Blog, which, as a usual convention (followed by me) is named after my handle at all the Competitive Coding Websites, **kshitij_07**.

> Feel free to suggest some better name :p

The Blog has been made on **Python's** Web-Development Framework **Django**, which I recently learned at [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/). This, coupled with its extension tutorial and the fascination to learn more decoration (read HTML and CSS) led to the origin of the idea of this blog.

The basic articles I intend to manage on the blog are :
- Competitive Programming
- Machine Learning
- Some of my Quora answers on JEE Preparation
- ..... Yeah, only this much so far.........

The proposed work that needs to do is :
- [ ]  Make the UI better, it sucks at the moment.
- [ ]  .....Umm... Yeah, let's do the first one first :p

Finally, the webpage is currently hosted [here](https://07kshitij.pythonanywhere.com/). You are welcome to check it out. In case you find any dissimilarity with the code here and the appearance of the webpage, or find the page empty, please don't go back, I would be probably experimenting something with it on the backend at that moment.
